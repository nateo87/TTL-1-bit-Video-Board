# TTL-1-bit-Video-Board
Here is a TTL-based, 1-bit video board as designed by David L. Heiserman in the book How to Design and Build Your Own Custom TV Games. Corrections have been made from the schematics in the book, mostly just pin number confusions (the later schematics have much more troublesome errors).
