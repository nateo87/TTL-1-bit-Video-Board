<b>THIS BOARD REVISION CONTAINS A CRITICAL ERROR</b>

The 74LS109 portion will not work in this instance. A 74LS112 can be bodged in with the corresponding signals, keeping in mind that both J and K need to be held high for the toggle function to work in-circuit (the 74LS109 has the J high and the K low).

A new revision is being designed currently and this old one will soon be deleted. 5/12/2025
